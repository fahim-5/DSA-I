Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository
Overview

This repository contains code written during the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. It encompasses implementations of various data structures and algorithms taught during the course.
Contents

The repository includes the following:

    Data Structures: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
    Algorithms: Implementations of common algorithms including sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (BFS, DFS), etc.
    Assignments: Solutions to assignments and projects assigned during the course.

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine to access the code.
    Navigate through the directories to find specific data structure or algorithm implementations.
    Open the files in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to study or modify the code.
